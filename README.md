# VanguardAuto

Hey there! I was getting really fed up with the idea of being constantly monitored while using Riot Vanguard, especially with all the concerns about data going to who knows where. So, I made **VanguardAuto**. It’s a simple tool that gives you control over Vanguard, letting you turn it on or off whenever you want, without needing to reboot your PC or deal with any of that command prompt nonsense.
